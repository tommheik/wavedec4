# wavedec4
 4D Discrete Wavelet Transform (real-valued wavelets) for Matlab

This is the respository for Matlab implementation of **4D** (4 dimensional) **discrete wavelet transform** and the corresponding **inverse transform** by Tommi Heikkilä (University of Helsinki, Department of Mathematics and Statistics).

Excellent book on anything wavelet related is "A wavelet tour of signal processing". *Elsevier, 1999* by Stéphane Mallat.

This implementation is more or less an extension of the 3D discrete wavelet transform and inverse (**wavedec3** and **waverec3** respectively) by M. Misiti, Y. Misiti, G. Oppenheim & J.M. Poggi for the Wavelet Toolbox.

### Requirements

Just like the lower dimensional **wavedec** implementations (which are included in Wavelet Toolbox) these functions require the Matlab's [Wavelet Toolbox](https://se.mathworks.com/products/wavelet.html) to work properly!
